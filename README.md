# Rocket League Training Game

The main objective of this project is to create a single-player game mode that serves as a training for the original game. In this mode, the player controls a car with the objective of scoring goals in a goal, interacting with a ball within a field delimited by walls.

The development of this game has been carried out using the OpenGL library, which has allowed us to implement 3D graphics and simulate the physics necessary to realistically recreate the interactions between the car, the ball and the elements of the playing field.

The ```MEMORIA.pdf``` file presented details the technical and implementation aspects of the project, covering from the description of the objects that make up the scenario to the tests carried out to verify its correct operation.
